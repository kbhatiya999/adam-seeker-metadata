# Object-Oriented Programming Experiments

This directory contains Python experiments focused on classes, objects, inheritance, and OOP concepts.

## Focus Areas

- **Class Definition**: Instance creation, attribute access, and initialization
- **Inheritance**: Method resolution order (MRO), super(), and multiple inheritance
- **Encapsulation**: Private attributes, property decorators, and data hiding
- **Polymorphism**: Method overriding and duck typing
- **Special Methods**: `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`, etc.
- **Class vs Instance**: Static methods, class methods, and instance methods
- **Composition vs Inheritance**: Design patterns and relationships

## Experiment Format

Each experiment file follows this structure:
- **Objective**: What we're testing
- **Code**: The experimental code
- **Output**: Embedded results showing Python's behavior
- **Analysis**: Key insights and observations
- **Takeaways**: Practical implications

## Files

- `inheritance_mro.py` - Method Resolution Order and multiple inheritance
- `property_encapsulation.py` - Property decorators and data validation
- `special_methods_behavior.py` - Magic methods and operator overloading

## Learning Goals

- Understand Python's object model
- Master inheritance and composition patterns
- Learn proper use of special methods
- Explore advanced OOP concepts and design patterns
