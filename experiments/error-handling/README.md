# Error Handling Experiments

This directory contains Python experiments focused on exception handling, debugging, and error management patterns.

## Focus Areas

- **Exception Types**: Built-in exceptions and custom exception hierarchies
- **Try-Except Blocks**: Exception catching, handling, and propagation
- **Finally and Else**: Cleanup operations and conditional execution
- **Context Managers**: Exception handling in resource management
- **Debugging**: Stack traces, logging, and error reporting
- **Custom Exceptions**: Creating meaningful error types
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation and retry patterns

## Experiment Format

Each experiment file follows this structure:
- **Objective**: What we're testing
- **Code**: The experimental code
- **Output**: Embedded results showing Python's behavior
- **Analysis**: Key insights and observations
- **Takeaways**: Practical implications

## Files

- `exception_propagation.py` - Exception bubbling and handling chains
- `custom_exception_hierarchy.py` - Creating and using custom exceptions
- `context_manager_exceptions.py` - Exception handling in context managers

## Learning Goals

- Master exception handling patterns
- Understand when and how to create custom exceptions
- Learn debugging and logging techniques
- Explore error recovery and resilience patterns
