# Data Structures Experiments

This directory contains Python experiments focused on understanding and analyzing various data structures and their behaviors.

## Focus Areas

- **Lists**: Mutable sequences, memory behavior, slicing operations
- **Tuples**: Immutable sequences, performance characteristics
- **Dictionaries**: Hash tables, key-value operations, memory usage
- **Sets**: Unordered collections, set operations, uniqueness
- **Strings**: Immutable text, string methods, encoding
- **Custom Data Structures**: Building and analyzing custom structures

## Experiment Format

Each experiment file follows this structure:
- **Objective**: What we're testing
- **Code**: The experimental code
- **Output**: Embedded results showing Python's behavior
- **Analysis**: Key insights and observations
- **Takeaways**: Practical implications

## Files

- `list_memory_behavior.py` - Memory allocation and modification patterns
- `dictionary_performance.py` - Hash table operations and collision handling
- `string_immutability.py` - String modification and memory implications

## Learning Goals

- Understand memory allocation patterns
- Analyze time complexity of operations
- Explore edge cases and unexpected behaviors
- Build intuition for choosing appropriate data structures
