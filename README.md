# Python Learning Experiments

A comprehensive repository for exploring Python behavior through hands-on experiments and analysis.

## üéØ Purpose

This repository serves as a laboratory for understanding Python's internals, behaviors, and best practices through practical experiments. Each experiment is designed to reveal specific aspects of Python's behavior with embedded outputs and detailed analysis.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

### Experiment Categories

- **[Data Structures](experiments/data-structures/)** - Lists, dictionaries, sets, and custom structures
- **[Functions](experiments/functions/)** - Closures, decorators, generators, and scope
- **[Object-Oriented Programming](experiments/oop/)** - Classes, inheritance, and design patterns
- **[File I/O](experiments/file-io/)** - File operations, encoding, and data persistence
- **[Error Handling](experiments/error-handling/)** - Exceptions, debugging, and recovery patterns

### Documentation

- **[Learning Notes Framework](docs/learning-notes.md)** - Structured approach to documenting insights
- **[Notion Workspace Integration](#notion-workspace)** - Direct links to organized learning materials

## üß™ Experiment Format

Each experiment follows a consistent structure:

1. **Objective** - What we're testing
2. **Code** - The experimental implementation
3. **Output** - Embedded results showing Python's behavior
4. **Analysis** - Key insights and observations
5. **Takeaways** - Practical implications and best practices

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to any experiment category
3. Run the Python files to see the experiments in action
4. Study the embedded outputs and analysis
5. Document your own insights using the learning framework
